rrplayer-fc (7.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now obeying the "blnAdvertsWaitForSongEnd" setting
    - Except when playing from LineIn, and not for "forced time" promos.
  * Logic to decide whether promo batches are allowed is more verbose in debug
    mode

rrplayer-fc (7.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implemented changes requested by Gerhard:
    - Adverts fetched from the database are first re-ordered before further
      processing.
      - First forced time ads, then ads from the current Format Clock segment,
        etc (See git commit ad9730dd for more info).
    - Updated logic for determining when adverts should be determined as
      missed (too long since they should have played).
      - We now (mostly) mark ads before the current hour as missed. The
        exception is when we are close to the start of the current hour.
    - Updated period in which adverts are fetched.
      - This is usually from the start of the current hour until the end of
        the current segment, but it can vary.
  * Other misc changes:
    - Fetching adverts slightly more accurately than before
    - Minor re-organization of PAYB logic
    - C++ pointer syntax updates (using "var->field" instead of
      "(*var).field")
