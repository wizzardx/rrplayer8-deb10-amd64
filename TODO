TODO:
  1) Improve music playlist randomization.
      -turn off randomize (do own randomize when profile changed?)
      -When adverts are about to start:
        - Move all songs above & including current point, to the end of the
          playlist file.
        - If we've gone through the entire playlist length, then randomize the playlist.
      
      -When the playlist ends:
        - Re-randomize the playlist & play.
        
        
      
      -remember position before advert
      -resume at next position after advert.
      -When the playlist ends, re-randomize the playlist.
  
  2) If the player can't connect to XMMS during startup, keep trying (don't terminate because of the exception)
  3) Announcement volume 0 = skip announcements. (use at that store of Annalies)  
  4) Allow percentage-based profiles
  5) Ability to play encrypted announcements.
  6) Ability to play ogg music and announcements
