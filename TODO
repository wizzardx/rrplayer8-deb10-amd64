* Setup automated unit tests
    -> Wanted by me
    - Start using BDD with all new player updates

* Fix transition problems with items that end too soon
  -> Wanted by Gerhard and Nadia
  - eg: LineIn that ends at end of segment, and next item wants to crossfade
        but can't, so playback starts too soon.
        - Fix this by making linein's end later (seg end + crossfade length?
  - eg: MP3s that end too soon, and next item wants to crossfade
    - Fix this by logging a warning and not cross-fading after all.

* Split LineIn into a separate format clock category
  -> Wanted by Gerhard (and originally VJ)
  - rrschedule-db:
    - Add a LineIn segment type
    - Update version number
  - rrplayer-fc:
    - Update rrschedule-db version dependency
    - Do the splitting
      - Remove from Music segment handling?
      - Allow LineIn to also be used in music segments?

* Enable forced-time segments
    -> Wanted by Gerhard and Riaan L. Nadia too?
    - rrschedule-db:
        - Add a blnforced_time setting to segments (default: FALSE, and NOT
          NULL?)
        - Add to segment cats: blnforced_time_interrupt_leeway - FALSE for
          music, and TRUE for everything else. Default to TRUE
        - Update version number
    - rrplayer-fc:
        - Update rrschedule-db version dependency
        - Refactor logic related to 'force time promo' (use same logic for it
          and 'force time segments')
        - Regularly (every 30s/60s?) check for the next forced-time ad/music
            - Also needs to be accurate to the second
            (eg: forced time ads/segment at 00:30:15 needs to start then, not
            00:30:00 or 00:31:00)
            - Also make sure that LineIn and Silence work this way

            - If there is something, then schedule the interrupt for that time:
            - If there is leeway (for the upcoming segment type (promo for
                forced-time-ads) at that time, ie time for the ad to finish,
                then don't schedule the interrupt.
            - When the 'current format clock time' to point to the start of the
              segment (not just current time), even if the previous item had
               some leeway.
            - this will skip segments that were before.
            - Also update regular 'get the next item' logic to get
              'forced time' segments before regular segments.
                - ie, similar to normal segments, when switching over (ie,
                  don't miss out small segments).
            - End of hour is allowed to interrupt forced-time segments (and
              promos)

* Check 192.168.0.31 for rrplayer-fc errors, and fix them

* Expire cached data periodically
 -> Wanted by Gerhard
 - This is so that it gets reloaded from db/disk
 - Includes cached pel collection and 'last music playlist'

* should confirm that xmms song pos is changing
  -> Wanted by Gerhard
  See this TODO for details:
     /home/david/doc/todo/soon/Gerhard: rrplayer-fc - check that xmms song position
        changes

* Use more fine-grained times internally, instead of seconds?
  -> Wanted by me
  - Research Boost date & time types & funcs.

* Replace XMMS with another MP3-playback backend
  -> Wanted by Gerhard, Nadia, and myself
  - We need to support extra gain, for stores with very soft sound cards.
  - We need to support CD audio.
  - Add unit tests to confirm these requirements
