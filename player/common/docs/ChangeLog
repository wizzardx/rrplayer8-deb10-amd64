  Removing Build Number stuff. Not really needed and it's a pain to get it working with the new "common" libs directory layout.
19/03/2005  
  Added a volume_slider class.
  Added a linein libaray (linein_getvol(), linein_setvol()).
  Removed "c" from the front of class definitions. "c" makes it look unnatural..
  I'll use "c" in front only when the compiler makes it necessary (doesn't want to combine types & vars using the same identifier).
  Removed the "Media Player" souce code... no longer used.
  Removed gnu headers
  Removed the code & logic for older-style config file handling. The new methods for loading are much better!
  Files with "rr" or "my" in front, now changed to "rr_" and "my_" - to make the filenames easier to read. "my" was added because of problems with existing C
  libraries that had the same name (as the file without the "my).
  Added normalise_timeval to my_time.h. Helps when doing maths with timeval structures.
  No longer using floating-point vars to store volumes. Unnecessary!
  xmms_controller - setvol - now waits for xmms to actually set the volume (can take up to 1/5th of a second sometimes. This was
                    causing logic problems!
  I found problems in my_time.. some places have daylight savings (looks like UK is one of them) and this really messes around
  with some of the time_t maths. Changed one or two functions to use "tm" conversions instead (getdatetime_date, get_datetime_time).
  Marked other functions in my_time as needing updates!

  strtobool now recognizes "t" and "f" (recognized just about everything else besides!)
  xmms_controller - now inintialized with a session number. Uses that instead of defaulting to session 0.
  xmms_controller - no longer has an imbedded mp3 tags-caching object.

17/03/2005
  - Added a chdir() function to file.h and file.cpp. Throws exceptions.
  - Renamed "rr_security.h" and "rr_security.cpp" to "rrsecurity.h" and "rrsecurity.cpp"
  - rrsecurity - Finally abolished string_encryption object and replaced it with *much* simpler to use "encrypt_string" and "decrypt_string" functions.
  - psql.h, psql.cppp - Now calling a callback function instead of a grotty "event" object, when there are connection errors.

16/03/2005
  - Taking advantage of a new Player version (7.00) to start using & these improved versions of the libraries I've been working on and improving at home.
  - Lots of improvements, including:
    - Tidier logging & exception-handling
    - The monolithic "rr_utils" has been broken down into sub-libraries. rr_utils is no more. Compilation should be much quicker now.
    - Naming conventions are more standard.
    - Extra functions developed & tested at home.
    - Windows compatible (tested & developed with DevCPP under Windows XP Pro).
    - Now I can use & develop with the same "common" libraries at home/hobby stuff, and at work.
      - If Radio Retail-specific code is in the "common" libraries, that is because I want to share the code between different RR projects, and not
        because I want to use it at home.
      - I distinguish Radio Retail source code files by having an "rr" at the front of the filename, eg: rrdate, rr_security.
    - These common libraries still need some work & testing (still busy porting stuff over from my old common libraries). I can do this a lot more
      efficiently with KDevelop than from DevCPP.
  ----------------
    - Added a "logging.h" #include to "exception.h"
    - Renamed some files because of naming conlicts in existing libraries.
      "string.h"   -> "mystring.h"
      "string.cpp" -> "mystring.cpp"
      "time.h"     -> "mytime.h"
      "time.cpp"   -> "mytime.cpp"
    - ick. Ugly file names but bearable.
    - Renamed "string.h" and "string.cpp" to "mystring.h" and "mystring.cpp". There were naming conflicts with another string.h in the system.
    - mystring.cpp - Changed an int var to an unsigned int to squelch a compiler warning.
    - psql.h, psql.cpp - Changing capitalization of function names. 
                       - Removed "rr_utils.h" #include.
                       - Removed using namespace rr line.
                       - Added "mytime.h" include.
                       - Replaced "rr_throw" calls with "my_throw"
                       - Added "exception.h" include.
                       - Added "mystring.h" include.
                       - Added "logging" include.
                       - Updated function calls where the name has changed.
                       - Changed "rr_exception" to "my_exception"
    - logging.h, logging.cpp: Added log_line, used for formatted text output that shouldn't go to the database.

  - Created this new changelog.
  - All earlier ChangeLogs are inside the "old.tar.gz" archive.
  - All common C libs are now in a single directory.
  - Source code libraries are now more manageable. No need for versioning each file, special
    compiler directives to library versions, etc.
  - Every time changes are made (ie, copied in from a project directory, eg player), a new backup copy of the 
    source code files is made into a "BACKUPS" directory
  - Removed all #include "check_library_versions.h"
  - Removed all version numbers
  - Moved "make_all_with_build_num.script" to a "scripts" subdirectory.
  - build_num.cpp - Changed location to find "make_all_with_build_num.script" under

23/02/2005    
  - rr_utils: MakeDateTime. Fixed a problem with the mktime logic. (-1 isn't always an error)
                            - There were errors when the exact date & time to be converted was
                              1970-01-01 01:59:59 (with the SA timezone of GMT+2, this converts to -1, ie
                              1 second before 1970-01-01 00:00:00, GMT+0).
