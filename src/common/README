cpp_common library, version 1.2.3

C++ libraries developed by David Purdy.

Originally apps symlinked to these files, but now with separate per-project
git checkouts, apps can each get their own copy of this set of libraries and
not waste space in a central repository.

HOW TO USE:

* Create your project in KDevelop (eg: command-line hello world example)

* In Automake Manager, add a new 'common' sub-project under src

* Add a new target to 'common'
    - Primary 'Library', Prefix 'noinst', File name 'common'

* Update your binary target's options, and link the src/common/libcommon.a
  convenience library.

* Copy and paste all the files (but not dirs and hidden files) from the
  cpp_common dir to your project's new "common" subdir.

* From your project, use one of the libs, eg:

    #include "common/mp3_tags.h"

    // And in main()
    mp3_tags tags;

* Try to compile. When that fails, start Existing Files to libcommon.a, eg:
    - dir_list.cpp
    - exception.cpp
    - file.cpp
    - logging.cpp
    - mp3_tags.cpp
    - my_string.cpp
    - my_time.cpp
    - string_splitter.cpp
    - system.cpp
