INTRODUCTION

This is rrplayer-fc, a rewrite of the original 'rrplayer' Player. It supports
Format Clocks and special item transition effects.

The Player controls sound output at the stores, by manipulating Linux sound
backends like XMMS and aumix.

AUTOMATED UNIT TESTS

The player now has automated unit tests [1].

The unit tests source code (tests.cpp) is dynamically generated during the
build process [2].

The tests are in cxxtest [3] format.

INSTALLING CXXTEST

Since cxxtest is not in Debian's repo, here are the steps to build and
install a .deb file:

 cd /tmp/
 wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/cxxtest/cxxtest-3.10.1-1.noarch.rpm
 fakeroot alien cxxtest-3.10.1-1.noarch.rpm
 sudo dpkg -i cxxtest_3.10.1-2_all.deb

[1] The unit tests are still a work in progress.

[2] See src/Makefile.am for details. See also the generated tests.cpp file
    found under the build dir.
